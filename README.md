## 🚀 Projects

| Project | Description | Links |
|---|---|---|
| ATT - DRDO | Worked on building a custom object detection pipeline using YOLO for real-time target identification.

Implemented ByteTrack for multi-object tracking to maintain consistent IDs across video frames.

Trained and tested models in Google Colab using PyTorch, optimizing performance with limited data resources.

Handled dataset preparation, annotation, and augmentation, including experiments with fog simulation to improve robustness.

Analyzed model performance using metrics like precision, recall, and mAP, and fine-tuned hyperparameters for better accuracy.

Gained practical exposure to end-to-end AI project workflow — from data preprocessing to deployment-ready models.

Strengthened skills in computer vision, deep learning, and real-time video analytics through defense-oriented use cases. | [GitHub](https://github.com/Meiyappan2006/Automatic_target_tracker) |
| Imagify- AI Image Converter | Imagify is an AI-powered image editing project designed to transform and personalize photos based on user requirements.

Built features to perform face-based transformations, including converting images into themed concepts like mom–son, dad–daughter, and creative edits.

Implemented computer vision techniques for face detection, alignment, and region-based editing to ensure natural-looking results. | [Live](https://imagify-client2-huhq.onrender.com/) / [GitHub](https://github.com/Meiyappan2006/Imagify) |
